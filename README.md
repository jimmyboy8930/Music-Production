## Overview

I have been passionate about music from an early age, with experiences in various instruments and digital production tools. Over the years, I've explored different genres and techniques, starting with traditional instruments and eventually diving into digital music production using FL Studio.

## Timeline of My Musical Experience

- **Piano (2 years)** – Elementary School  
  My journey began with the piano, where I developed a foundational understanding of music and basic techniques.

- **Violin (2 years)** – Elementary School  
  After piano, I transitioned to the violin, expanding my appreciation for classical music and learning about string techniques.

- **Saxophone (1 year)** – Elementary School  
  I experimented with the saxophone for a year, which introduced me to wind instruments and further broadened my musical skill set.

- **Piano (2 years)** – High School  
  Returning to the piano during high school allowed me to deepen my skills and rekindle my love for this instrument.

- **FL Studio & Digital Production (College)**  
  In college, I shifted focus to digital production, where I began learning **music theory** and **chord progressions** while experimenting with making my own music. FL Studio has since become my primary tool for creating and producing tracks.

## Current Focus

I am currently working on improving my music theory knowledge and refining my skills in FL Studio, with my piano keyboard. My goal is to create complex compositions that reflect my journey through both traditional and digital music-making. 

Stay tuned for more music as I continue to grow in this exciting space!
